            <h2>In short</h2>
            <p>Minamoto (源) was one of the surnames bestowed by the Emperors of Japan upon members of the imperial family who were excluded from the line of succession and demoted into the ranks of the nobility. The practice was most prevalent during the Heian period (794–1185 CE), although its last occurrence was during the Sengoku period. The Taira were another such offshoot of the imperial dynasty, making both clans distant relatives. The Minamoto clan is also called the Genji (源氏), using the Sino-Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese characters for Minamoto (gen, from Middle Chinese ngüon) and family (ji, from MC dʒje).</p>

            <h2>Members of the Minamoto clan</h2>
            <p>Even within royalty there was a distinction between princes with the title shinnō (親王) (“[having the] ability to advance”, i.e., eligible to become the new Emperor), who could ascend to the throne, and princes with the title ō (王) (“great” or “major”), who were not members of the line of imperial succession but nevertheless remained members of the royal class (and therefore outranked members of Minamoto clans). The bestowing of the Minamoto name on a (theretofore-)prince or his descendants excluded them from the royal class altogether, thereby operating as a reduction in legal and social rank even for ō-princes not previously in the line of succession.</p>
